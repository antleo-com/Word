The apostle Paul uses the verb (flee: φεύγω) four times in his writings. Interestingly, in all the four instances, he uses the imperative mood in the present tense.

- Flee fornication (φευγετε την πορνειαν) - 1 Cor 6:18
- Flee idolatry (φευγετε απο της ειδωλολατριας) - 1 Cor 10:14
- Flee all kinds of evil that come as a result of the love of money (ταῦτα φεῦγε) - 1 Tim 6:11
- Flee youthful lusts (τὰς δὲ νεωτερικὰς ἐπιθυμίας φεῦγε) - 2 Tim 2:22

The use of the present tense tell us that the fleeing is not a one time act but will require to be done repeatedly. This is because in the ancient greek language, the present tense is seen as a continuous action in the present, commonly taught by many greek grammarians as the continuous aspect. In the greek verbal forms, the aspect is generally more important and emphasised than the time of the action. So, the continuous aspect of the present tense is also an indicator that these four types of temptations are ever present and will require constant vigilance and the readiness to flee. Unsurprisingly, the Word does tell us elsewhere that our hearts are incurably evil and incredibly deceitful.

Second, the imperative mood tells us that these flee verses are not suggestions we can choose whether or not to implement, or at lesiure, but are to be taken as direct commands requiring unquestioning and immediate action. The verb φεύγω comes with a sense of urgency. It is used 26 times in the NT and every time the act of fleeing whether described or commanded implies urgency whether from fear of loss, death, or persecution. For example in Matt 2, the angel commanded Joseph to flee to Egypt to save the baby Jesus from an early death. In Matt 8, the keepers of the pigs seeing what the demons had done to their pigs were overcome by fear and fled to the city, in Luke 3, the Lord saw the multitude coming to him fearfully fleeing from the wrath to come. It also carries the sense of escaping as a result of fleeing, for example in Heb 11:34 talking about the faithful escaping the edge of the sword. So in short, the command is urgently to be obeyed if we are to escape the ill effects of not doing so.

Lastly, these flee commands do not prescribe where one is to run to. The idea perhaps is that when one is escaping danger one may not really have a destination in mind, but just the intense, instinctive desire to get away from the scene of danger.

May the Spirit help us not to linger when we need to flee!
