Often when faced with difficult choices, one obsesses about what really is the will of God. At other times, one scarcely pays a thought to this difficult to grasp concept, and proceeds with one's own decisions. But for Christ, the will of God was His whole life's purpose. 

> Heb 10:7 (also in verse 9):
> 
> τότε εἶπον· Ἰδοὺ ἥκω, ἐν κεφαλίδι βιβλίου γέγραπται περὶ ἐμοῦ, τοῦ ποιῆσαι, ὁ θεός, **τὸ θέλημά σου**.
> 
> Then I said, ‘Behold, I have come to do your will, O God,  
> as it is written of me in the scroll of the book.

He also taught his disciples to pray about the will of God.

> Matt 6:10
> ἐλθέτω ἡ βασιλεία σου, γενηθήτω τὸ θέλημά σου, ὡς ἐν οὐρανῷ καὶ ἐπὶ γῆς·
> Your kingdom come, your will be done, on earth as it is in heaven.

The word *θέλημα* (Theleema; Strong's G2307), which means will, decision, or desire, occurs about 63 times in the NT. More particularly, the phrases θέλημα τοῦ θεοῦ / θέλημα θεοῦ / θέλημα τοῦ πατρός mean "the will of God/the will of the Father". Often, a better sense of the verse may be gotten to by translating the word *θέλημα* as desire instead of will.

What the Lord brought about by pursuing the will of God was untold blessings for millions. 

> Heb 10:10
> ἐν ᾧ θελήματι ἡγιασμένοι ἐσμὲν διὰ τῆς προσφορᾶς τοῦ σώματος Ἰησοῦ Χριστοῦ ἐφάπαξ.

> And by that will we have been sanctified through the offering of the body of Jesus Christ once for all.

So what about us? What exactly does the will of God translate to for an ordinary Christian? To help us understand this, here are a few other instances in the scriptures of this key phrase:

> 1 Thess 4:3: 
> 
> τοῦτο γάρ ἐστιν **θέλημα τοῦ θεοῦ,** ὁ ἁγιασμὸς ὑμῶν, ἀπέχεσθαι ὑμᾶς ἀπὸ τῆς πορνείας,
> 
> For this is the will of God your sanctification: that you abstain from sexual immorality;

The sanctification of the children of God, and their abstaining from immoral sexual conduct, is the desire of God.

> 1 Thess 5:18
> 
> ἐν παντὶ εὐχαριστεῖτε· τοῦτο γὰρ **θέλημα θεοῦ** ἐν Χριστῷ Ἰησοῦ εἰς ὑμᾶς.
> 
> give thanks in all circumstances; for this is the will of God in Christ Jesus for you.

The giving of thanks in everything (not necessarily publicly) is the desire of God, and here using the imperative tense εὐχαριστεῖτε he commands it. His children ought to give thanks to Him always not only because He commands it but also because obeying this command gives Him the satisfaction of His desire.

> Matt 21:31
> τίς ἐκ τῶν δύο ἐποίησεν τὸ **θέλημα τοῦ πατρός**; λέγουσιν· Ὁ πρῶτος. λέγει αὐτοῖς ὁ Ἰησοῦς· Ἀμὴν λέγω ὑμῖν ὅτι οἱ τελῶναι καὶ αἱ πόρναι προάγουσιν ὑμᾶς εἰς τὴν βασιλείαν τοῦ θεοῦ.
> 
> Which of the two did the will of his father?” They said, “The first.” Jesus said to them, “Truly, I say to you the tax collectors and the prostitutes go into the kingdom of God before you.

> Heb 10:36
> ὑπομονῆς γὰρ ἔχετε χρείαν ἵνα τὸ θέλημα τοῦ θεοῦ ποιήσαντες κομίσησθε τὴν ἐπαγγελίαν·
> For you have need of endurance, so that when you have done the will of God you may receive what is promised.

It might be assumed that doing the will of God will be a rewarding experience. But nothing could be further from the truth in a fallen world. Like for the Lord, so it is for us; the will of God is not immediately rewarding, but requires patience to see its fruit.
