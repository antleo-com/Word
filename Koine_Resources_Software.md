## Koine Software

Here are some helpful software tools if you're on the road to learning Koine greek: 

* [Bible Strong App](){:target="_blank"} : For Android tablets, I find the free Bible Strong app to be an excellent tool to read and reference the Koine. It is not too heavy on features and has a very usable interface to read the greek directly or with the help of an interlinear. Side Note: I use a Boox tablet with an e-ink screen which is very good for the eyes. These are available from [the Boox website](https://www.boox.com/){:target="_blank"}
* [Step Bible](https://www.stepbible.org/downloads.jsp){:target="_blank"} : This is a good, free bible app with ancient languages included that is available online and for desktop, mobile. It has many, many versions and languages of the Bible with helpful tools and aids for original language studies. I use this on my desktop.
* [Bible-Discovery](http://www.bible-discovery.com/bible-download.php){:target="_blank"} : Another free bible study software with original languages. I haven't used this one much but will do so and update here. However, I see that many of the useful features are available free only for a 10-day trial period
