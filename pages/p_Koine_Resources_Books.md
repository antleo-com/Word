## Koine Books

Here are some helpful books if you're on the road to learning Koine greek: 

* Basics of Biblical Greek by William D Mounce: Highly recommended as it makes what is quite tough, somewhat easy
* Basics of Biblical Greek: If you are self-learning, this is an essential companion to the text book, without which it will be difficult to practice and retain the learnings
* A Manual greek lexicon of the New Testament by G. Abbott-Smith: Though there are many online lexicons as listed below, if you prefer a physical lexicon, this is a good one
* Greek Verbs in the New Testament and Their Principal Parts by Laurence Vance: Once I was done going through the basics, I found principle parts of the verbs to be quite complex. This helpful book lists them all. I haven't bought this one yet but its on my wish list
* Greek grammar beyond the basics by Daniel B Wallace: Once done with Mounce, this is the next recommended step into intermediate greek, as recommended by Mounce himself
